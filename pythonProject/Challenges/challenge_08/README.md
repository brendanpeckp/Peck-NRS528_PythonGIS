# Coding Challenge 8

Our coding challenge this week follows from the last exercise that we did in class during Week 8 where we worked with functions.

Convert some of your earlier code into a function. The only rules are: 1) You must do more than one thing to your input to the function, and 2) the function must take two arguments or more. You must also, 3) provide a zip file of example data within your repo.

Plan the task to take an hour or two, so use one of the simpler examples from our past classes.
