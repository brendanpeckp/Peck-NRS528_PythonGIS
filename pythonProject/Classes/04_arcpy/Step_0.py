# Step 0 - Practice tasks before we start.

# Task a: Express the following sequence as lists:

##### Create a list of floats 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, call it "floatList", print it.


##### Create a  list of individual words using the sentence: "The lake is a long way from here" and
##### call it "strList", print it.
string = "The lake is a long way from here"


# Task b: Using a for loop, do the following:

##### Sum the values of floatList and print result (28.0) using a for loop, yes you can use: print(sum(intList)),
##### call it floatValue, print it

### floatlist
FloatList = float(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0)
print(FloatList)


total = 0
for item in FloatList:
    print(item)

strList = "The lake is a long way from here"
print(strList)
