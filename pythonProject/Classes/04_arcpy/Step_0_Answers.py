# Step 0 - Practice tasks before we start.

# Task a: Express the following sequence as lists:

##### Create a list of floats 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, call it "floatList", print it.
floatList = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0]

##### Create a  list of individual words using the sentence: "The lake is a long way from here" and
##### call it "strList", print it. I want you to "split" the string at white space.
string = "The lake is a long way from here"

strList = ["The", "lake", "is", "a", "long", "way", "from", "here"]
strList = string.split(" ")

print(strList)


# Task b: Using a for loop, do the following:

##### Sum the values of floatList and print result (28.0) using a for loop, yes you can use: print(sum(floatList)),
##### call it floatValue, print it

print(sum(floatList))

result = 0

for f in floatList:
    result += f
print(result)
