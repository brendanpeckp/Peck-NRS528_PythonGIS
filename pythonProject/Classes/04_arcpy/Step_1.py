# # Step 1 - arcpy: The arcpy module
# #####
#
# # Part a - Importing
#
# # The arcpy package gives you access to nearly all ArcGIS functions present in Desktop, and
# # we can import arcpy in various ways:
#
# ##### Import a single specific tool:
# from arcpy import Buffer_analysis as ba
#
# ##### Import all tools:
# import arcpy
#
# ##### We can now refer to the same tool as either:
#
# arcpy.Buffer_analysis() # Imported and referred to by the arcpy.* package naming convention, Buffer_
# # analysis() on it's own will not work.
#
# ba() # As we imported the tool specifically as ba, we can refer to it as ba.
#
#
# # Part a - Time to load
#
# # ##### Below, I want to show you the load speed for a specific tool using
# # the time package, note there is no real benefit as arcpy is slow:
#
import time
ba_start_time = time.time()
from arcpy import Buffer_analysis as ba
print('It took', time.time()-ba_start_time, 'seconds, to load ba.')

# import time
# arcpy_start_time = time.time()
# import arcpy
# print('It took', time.time()-arcpy_start_time, 'seconds, to load arcpy.')
