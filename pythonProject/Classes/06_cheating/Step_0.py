# Express this string of input files as a list, call the resulting list listFiles and print it:

stringFiles = "file1.asc;file2.asc;file3.asc;file4.asc;file5.asc"
print(stringFiles)


# How many files are in the list?
print("There are " + str(len(stringFiles)) + " files.")
listfiles = stringFiles.split(";")

# Take this list of files (listFiles), and using a for loop, go through each file name and print it.
listfiles = ()
for file in stringFiles:
    print(file)

# Now, using the code below, create those files, and add a small piece of text ("this is my file") to each file:
# file_create = open(**FILENAME**, "w")
# file_create.write("This is my file\n")


# Now do the opposite, read the contents of each file and print it, here is some example code:
# file = open("testfile.txt", "r")
# file_contents = file.read()
# print (file_contents)
# file.close()
