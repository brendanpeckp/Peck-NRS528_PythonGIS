# Coding Challenge 1

Please create a Github Repository (and if you don't already have one, a Github account), which contains a simple "README.md" file that describes yourself and your interests, sort of a profile if you will. You can used made up data if you wish, but feel free to use real data about yourself. Also, ensure that you set up your Github account with avatar, any additional information etc.

You must use Github markdown (here is a helpful [link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)), and express yourself using a variety of markdown styles (headings, images, links etc). Try to explore as much as you can. Markdown is used extensively throughout the web, not only on Github (e.g. Reddit, Stackoverflow etc).

You must submit this repository to your Github account.

**Please do this before our next class.**
