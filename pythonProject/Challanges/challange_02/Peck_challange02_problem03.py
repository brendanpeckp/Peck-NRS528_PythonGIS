## ```
## 1. Count the occurrence of each word, and print the word plus the count (hint, you might want to "split" this into a list by a white space: " ").

# string = 'hi dee hi how are you mr dee'
# word_list = string.split()
# (word_list)
# ([[x,word_list.count(x)] for x in set(word_list)])
# print(dict((x,word_list.count(x)) for x in set(word_list)))
#
